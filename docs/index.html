  This project served as an interesting introduction into the area of graphics and its implementation in software projects. This was a tedious yet rewarding introduction into understanding how graphic effects are implemented as well as understanding how digital computers are able to render so many interesting images. Having personally taken graphics and digital images and UI for granted, this project has opened my eyes to level of detail and mathematics involved in creating beautiful digital images. During this project, I encountered problems as it related to figuring out how to appropriately and dynamically resize the sample_buffer when we supersample. This project in a nutshell was a great introduction into raster graphics and texture mapping. It laid the foundation for how graphics are created and will seemingly be useful as we continue this course.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>
Drawing Single-Color Triangles
Rasterization is the process of converting triangles to pixels in a frame buffer. First, we sample to see which pixel center’s are inside the triangle. And finally, if they are in the triangle (which we mathematically calculate) then we color that pixel and load that location in the frame buffer as a visual approximation of the triangle. 

To test whether the points are in the triangle, we first create line equations for each side of the triangle. Then, we create a vector from the sampled point to each of the triangle vertices: If all the vectors are the same sign, we  know the point is in the triangle and can fill in the pixel.

We optimize our algorithm by cutting down our sample size through creating a bounding box over the triangle and sampling that region only. We find the bounding box through finding X and Y lower and upper bounds based on the triangle coordinates passed in. Because this is nearly the exact bounding box process from the problem description our algorithm can be no worse as it does essentially the same thing.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
<p> 
Antialiasing by Supersampling
Antialiasing is the idea that when signal changes very quickly, our sampling efforts are too slow to capture high frequency signals and causes the rendered image to appear very jaggy. We solve this antialiasing problem by filtering out high frequencies before sampling. We do this through super sampling. Super sampling allows us to avoid aliasing around the borders of the triangle. Supersampling involves taking the average of multiple samples per pixel to get a blurred effect. We do this to approximate the effect of the 1-pixel box filter technique to solve aliasing from lecture. Once we take the nXn samples “inside” each pixel, we take the average of the to come up with the final value of the color that is going to populate the pixel in the perspective of the frame buffer. The cause of antialiasing in our case is because the frequency near the edges of the triangles are too high and by increasing the sampling rate, we can attenuate signals above the Nyquist frequency. To store the increased amount of data in the sample_buffer, I dynamically increase the size of the buffer according to the sample_rate. Then, it was a matter of correctly indexing into the 1D Data structure and retrieving the supersampled points.

*rate = 1

<img src="images/image1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>

*rate = 4

<img src="images/image1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>

*rate = 16

In the images above, we can see that as the rate progressively increases, the angle at the right edge of the red triangle gets smoother as well. Rate = 1 is very jaggy while rate = 16 is quite smooth and blurred.
